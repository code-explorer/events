In order to package and distribute your electron application, you can use [Electron Forge](https://www.electronforge.io/).

## Installing Electron Forge

Run the following command to install electron forge:

```console
npm install --save-dev @electron-forge/cli
npx electron-forge import
```

## Package Application

To build your application for distribution, run the command:

```console
npm run make
```

This will create a folder called `out` which contains your application ready for distribution.
