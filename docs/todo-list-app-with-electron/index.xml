Modifying index.html # To get started let us modify the html file so that we can start adding todos.
Let us add a title and a div which can store the todos. Replace the body of index.html with the following:
&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Todo List&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;todos&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; In electron, the main script file (in our case main.js) cannot directly access and modify the html page.</description></item><item><title>Adding Todos</title><link>https://code-explorer.github.io/docs/todo-list-app-with-electron/adding-todos/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Mar 2022 20:04:53 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://code-explorer.github.io/docs/todo-list-app-with-electron/adding-todos/</guid><description>Now let us add some functionality to add some todos.
Adding text box and button # First, let us add a button and a textbox where we can enter and add todos.
We can do this by adding the following lines of code to the body of our html just below the div which contains the todos.
&amp;lt;input id=&amp;quot;add-inp&amp;quot; type=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;button id=&amp;quot;add-btn&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Add&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt; Also let us change the title to say To-do list app.</description></item><item><title>Enabling Data Persistence</title><link>https://code-explorer.github.io/docs/todo-list-app-with-electron/enabling-data-persistence/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Mar 2022 20:24:05 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://code-explorer.github.io/docs/todo-list-app-with-electron/enabling-data-persistence/</guid><description>At this point you might have noticed that after adding any todos, if you restart your application, the todos don&amp;rsquo;t stay.
To do this we will need to store your todos to memory. There are 2-ways in which you can store data to disk. Firstly, we can use a database. However, this involves complex setup and maintenance. The second way to do this is to store our data directly to a file.</description></item><item><title>Adding Bootstrap</title><link>https://code-explorer.github.io/docs/todo-list-app-with-electron/adding-bootstrap/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Mar 2022 00:13:27 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://code-explorer.github.io/docs/todo-list-app-with-electron/adding-bootstrap/</guid><description>As a final step to our project let use the bootstrap css library to make our app look appealing.
